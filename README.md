# [Homepage CV](https://aapokokko.fi/)

A CV website I created, while first learning basic web development with HTML and CSS. PHP is mostly used force https connection and to add modularity to the code. I made the website without a framework to work on learning CSS styling.

The website is hosted in an Azure VM deployed with this Terraform architecture with Nginx setup by these Ansibles.
